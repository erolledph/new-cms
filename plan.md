## Detailed Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Foundation

**Task 1: Firebase Project Setup**
This task establishes the foundation of your Firebase infrastructure. You'll create a new Firebase project in the Firebase Console, which serves as the central hub for all Firebase services. Enable Firebase Authentication with the Email/Password provider to allow users to register and sign in using their email addresses. Initialize Firestore Database in Native mode for optimal performance and scalability. Configure Firebase Storage to handle file uploads and management. Obtain all necessary Firebase configuration details including API Key, Auth Domain, Project ID, Storage Bucket, Messaging Sender ID, and App ID. Update the existing `.env.example` file with placeholders for these Firebase configuration variables. Create a new `.env` file from the example and populate it with your actual Firebase credentials. This setup ensures your application can communicate securely with Firebase services.

**Task 2: Basic Project Structure & Dependencies**
Install the Firebase SDK using `npm install firebase` to enable Firebase functionality in your application. Create `src/firebase.js` as the central configuration file that initializes the Firebase app using environment variables from your `.env` file. This file will import and configure Firebase services (Auth, Firestore, Storage) and export them for use throughout your application. Create `src/main.js` as the main entry point that imports the Firebase configuration and sets up the basic application structure. Update `index.html` to properly link to your main JavaScript file and ensure the application loads correctly. This establishes the foundational file structure and dependencies needed for the entire CMS.
