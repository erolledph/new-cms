Please review the plan.md file, specifically focusing on Phase x. Your task is to complete all actions necessary to bring the website described in Phase x live and fully functional. Once all tasks are complete, please confirm that Phase x  is successfully launched and operational.

Please provide a detailed confirmation for Phase X. Specifically, I need verification that:

All tasks outlined for Phase X have been fully completed according to the plan.md specifications.

The output of Phase X is fully functional and operational, demonstrating stable performance in its intended environment (e.g., live, staging, testing).

Any dependencies for subsequent phases have been met and verified.

All required documentation, testing, and quality assurance checks for Phase X are finalized and approved.

Confirming these points will allow us to confidently proceed to the next stage.
